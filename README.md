A fork of the official [Obsidian Web Clipper](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-clipper), adapted for Logseq. Logseq Web Clipper is a browser extension that helps you highlight and save web pages. 

## Developers

To build the extension:

```
npm run build
```

This will create three directories:
- `dist/` for the Chromium version
- `dist_firefox/` for the Firefox version
- `dist_safari/` for the Safari version

### Install the extension locally

For Chromium browsers, such as Chrome, Brave, Edge, and Arc:

1. Open your browser and navigate to `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable **Developer mode**
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select the `dist` directory

For Firefox:

1. Open Firefox and navigate to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
2. Click **Load Temporary Add-on**
3. Navigate to the `dist_firefox` directory and select the `manifest.json` file
